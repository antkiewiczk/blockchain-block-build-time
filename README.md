Blockchain block build time checker

This project uses Metamask chrome plugin to connect to Ethereum Blockchain. It lets user check the average block build time counting from the most recent block to the block x number earlier, where x is the user input.

It also displays a line chart showing build time for every block in between. The chart makes some time to draw so I've implemented a nice loader to enhance user experience.

The project is built on react. It uses sass as css preprocessor.
